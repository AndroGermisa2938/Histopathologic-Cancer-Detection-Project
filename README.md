# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Kaggle Competition Mini-Project

This repository serves as a submission for the Introduction To Deep Learning course week 3 project. The prompt for the project was to participate in the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) Kaggle challenge. The goal was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that would be trained on image data provided by the challenge, and optimize the model to classify images of Cancerous/Non-cancerous cells.

I built two models: A baseline model, and a similar model optimized using RMSprop rather than Adam optimizer. I comared the performance of both models, and used the one with higher accuracy to generate a submission for the challenge.

This repository contains the Jupiter Notebook with my work for the project, as well as a screenshot of the result of my submission. I will also add a link to my kaggle notebook below.
